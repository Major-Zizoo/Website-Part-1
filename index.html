            <p><img src="/2.jpg" height="100" width="100">Ice cream is a frozen dessert typically made from 
              milk or cream that has been flavoured with a 
              sweetener, either sugar or an alternative, and a spice,
               such as cocoa or vanilla, or with fruit, such as strawberries
                or peaches. Food colouring is sometimes added in addition to
                 stabilizers. The mixture is cooled below the freezing point
                  of water and stirred to incorporate air spaces and prevent
                   detectable ice crystals from forming. It can also be made
                    by whisking a flavoured cream base and liquid nitrogen
                     together. The result is a smooth, semi-solid foam that
                      is solid at very low temperatures
                       (below 2 °C or 35 °F).
                        It becomes more malleable as its
                         temperature increases.</p>

                        <p><img src="/3.jpg"  height="100" width="100">Ice cream may be served in dishes, eaten with a spoon,
                             or licked from edible wafer ice cream cones held by
                              the hands as finger food. Ice cream may be served 
                              with other desserts—such as cake or pie—or used as 
                              an ingredient in cold dishes—like ice cream floats, 
                              sundaes, milkshakes, and ice cream cakes—or in baked 
                              items such as Baked Alaska.</p>
